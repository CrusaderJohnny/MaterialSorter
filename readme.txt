Welcome to the Material sorter app!

We are developing this application as a way to allow users to get an idea of construction materials they can use in a building project.

The application allows the user to select up to 5 criteria and ranks materials based on the multiple criteria selected by the user.

The data returned is formatted and displayed in a table that displays by sub categories (IE: Foundation, Walls, Floors, Roofs).

All data within the tables is ranked by a multiple criteria decision making formula and given an aggregate value to rate it in combination with the other criteria.
